# Shift-To-Middle Array

The **Shift-To-Middle Array** is a dynamic array designed to optimize **insertions and deletions at both ends**, offering a high-performance alternative to `std::deque`, `std::vector`, and linked lists. It achieves this while maintaining **contiguous memory storage**, improving **cache locality** and enabling **efficient parallel processing**.

## 🌟 Features
✅ **Amortized O(1) insertions & deletions at both ends**  
✅ **Fast random access (O(1))**  
✅ **Better cache locality than linked lists**  
✅ **Supports SIMD & parallel optimizations**  
✅ **Efficient memory usage compared to `std::deque`**  

## 📌 How It Works
Unlike `std::deque`, which uses a fragmented block structure, the **Shift-To-Middle Array** dynamically **redistributes space** to avoid costly shifts. When resizing, elements are moved toward the middle, ensuring **efficient insertions at both ends** without excessive copying.

## 🚀 Time Complexity Comparison

The following table compares the time complexity of Shift-To-Middle Array operations with other common data structures:

| Operation                  | ArrayList (`std::vector`) | Linked List | Shift-To-Middle Array |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Access (by index)          | O(1)                     | O(n)        | O(1)                 |
| Insertion at head          | O(n)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Insertion at tail          | O(1) amortized           | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Insertion in middle        | O(n)                     | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Deletion at head           | O(n)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Deletion at tail           | O(1)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Deletion in middle         | O(n)                     | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Cache Locality             | Excellent                | Poor        | Excellent            |

## 🏛 History
The **Shift-To-Middle Array** was developed as part of an effort to create a more efficient **implementation strategy for lists and deques**. Traditional data structures, such as `std::deque` and linked lists, suffer from **poor cache locality** or **fragmented memory allocations**, leading to inefficiencies. By leveraging **contiguous memory**, dynamic mid-shifting, and modern CPU optimizations, Shift-To-Middle Array provides a **balanced solution** for insertion, deletion, and access performance.
